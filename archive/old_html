<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<em>i.landsat8.swlst</em> is an implementation of the robust and practical
Slit-Window (SW) algorithm estimating land surface temperature, from the
Thermal Infra-Red Sensor (TIRS) aboard Landsat 8 with an accuracy of better
than 1.0 K.

<h3>Details</h3>
A new refinement of the generalized split-window algorithm
proposed by Wan (2014) [19] is added with a quadratic term of
the difference amongst the brightness temperatures (Ti, Tj) of
the adjacent thermal infrared channels, which can be expressed
as (equation 2 in the paper [0])
<p>
<tt>LST = b0 + [b1 + b2 * (1−ε)/ε + b3 * (Δε/ε2)] * (Ti+T)/j2 + [b4 + b5 * (1−ε)/ε + b6 * (Δε/ε2)] * (Ti−Tj)/2 + b7 * (Ti−Tj)^2</tt>
<p>
where:

- Ti and Tj are Top of Atmosphere brightness temperatures
measured in channels i (~11.0 μm) and j (~12.0 µm),
respectively;
    - from http://landsat.usgs.gov/band_designations_landsat_satellites.php:
    - Band 10, Thermal Infrared (TIRS) 1, 10.60-11.19, 100*(30)
    - Band 11, Thermal Infrared (TIRS) 2, 11.50-12.51, 100*(30)

- ε is the average emissivity of the two channels (i.e., ε = 0.5
[εi + εj]),

- Δε is the channel emissivity difference (i.e., Δε = εi − εj);

- bk (k = 0,1,...7) are the algorithm coefficients derived in
the following simulated dataset.
<p>
[...]
<p>
In the above equations,

    - dk (k = 0, 1...6) and ek (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) are the
    algorithm coefficients;

    - w is the CWV;

    - ε and ∆ε are the average emissivity and emissivity
    difference of two adjacent thermal channels, respectively,
    which are similar to Equation (2);

    - and fk (k = 0 and 1) is related to the influence of the
    atmospheric transmittance and emissivity, i.e., f k =
    f(εi,εj,τ i ,τj).
<p>
Note that the algorithm (Equation (6a)) proposed by
Jiménez-Muñoz et al. added CWV directly to estimate LST.
<p>
Rozenstein et al. used CWV to estimate the atmospheric
transmittance (τi, τj) and optimize retrieval accuracy
explicitly.
<p>
Therefore, if the atmospheric CWV is unknown or cannot be
obtained successfully, neither of the two algorithms in
Equations (6a) and (6b) will work. By contrast, although our
algorithm also needs CWV to determine the coefficients, this
algorithm still works for unknown CWVs because the coefficients
are obtained regardless of the CWV, as shown in Table 1.

<h3>Cloud Masking</h3>
The first important step of the algorithm is cloud screening. The module offers
two ways to achieve this:

1) use of the Quality Assessment band and some user-defined QA pixel value

2) use an external cloud map as an inverted MASK

<h3>Calibration of TIRS channels 10, 11</h3>

<h4>Conversion to Spectral Radiance</h4>
Conversion of Digital Numbers to TOA Radiance. OLI and TIRS band data
can be converted to TOA spectral radiance using the radiance rescaling
factors provided in the metadata file:

<tt>Lλ = ML * Qcal + AL</tt>

where:

- Lλ = TOA spectral radiance (Watts/( m2 * srad * μm))

- ML = Band-specific multiplicative rescaling factor from the metadata
(RADIANCE_MULT_BAND_x, where x is the band number)

- AL = Band-specific additive rescaling factor from the metadata
(RADIANCE_ADD_BAND_x, where x is the band number)

- Qcal = Quantized and calibrated standard product pixel values (DN)

<h4>Conversion to at-Satellite Temperature</h4>
Conversion to At-Satellite Brightness Temperature
TIRS band data can be converted from spectral radiance to brightness
temperature using the thermal constants provided in the metadata file:

<tt>T = K2 / ln((K1/Lλ) + 1)</tt>


where:
<p>
- T = At-satellite brightness temperature (K)

- Lλ = TOA spectral radiance (Watts/( m2 * srad * μm)), below
    'DUMMY_RADIANCE'

- K1 = Band-specific thermal conversion constant from the metadata
    (K1_CONSTANT_BAND_x, where x is the band number, 10 or 11)

- K2 = Band-specific thermal conversion constant from the metadata
    (K2_CONSTANT_BAND_x, where x is the band number, 10 or 11)

<h3>Land Surface Emissivity</h3>
An overview of "Section 3.2: Determination of LSEs":

1) The FROM-GLC (30m) contains 10 types of land covers (cropland,
forest, grassland, shrubland, wetland, waterbody, tundra, impervious, barren
land and snow-ice).

2) Deriving emissivities for each land cover class by using different
combinations of three BRDF kernel models (geometrical, volumetric and specular
models)

3) Vegetation and ground emissivity spectra for the BRDF models selected
from the MODIS University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Emissivity
Library

4) Estimating FVC (to obtain emissivity of land cover with temporal variation))
from NDVI based on Carlson (1997) and Sobrino (2001)

5) Finally, establishing the average emissivity Look-Up table

<h3>Column Water Vapor</h3>
Retrieving atmospheric column water vapor from Landsat8 TIRS data based on
the modified split-window covariance and variance ratio (MSWCVR).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Note,* this class produces valid expressions for GRASS GIS' mapcalc raster
processing module and does not directly compute column water vapor
estimations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With a vital assumption that the atmosphere is unchanged over the
neighboring pixels, the MSWCVR method relates the atmospheric CWV to the
ratio of the upward transmittances in two thermal infrared bands, whereas
the transmittance ratio can be calculated based on the TOA brightness
temperatures of the two bands.

Considering N adjacent pixels, the CWV in the MSWCVR method is estimated
as:

- <tt>cwv = c0 + c1*(tj/ti) + c2*(tj/ti)^2</tt>

- tj/ti ~ Rji = SUM [ ( Tik - Ti_mean ) * ( Tjk - Tj_mean ) ] /
                SUM [ ( Tik - Tj_mean )^2 ]

In Equation (3a):

- c0, c1 and c2 are coefficients obtained from simulated data;

- τ is the band effective atmospheric transmittance;

- N is the number of adjacent pixels (excluding water and cloud pixels)
in a spatial window of size n (i.e., N = n × n);

- Ti,k and Tj,k are Top of Atmosphere brightness temperatures (K) of
bands i and j for the kth pixel;

- mean(Ti) and mean(Tj) are the mean or median brightness temperatures of
the N pixels for the two bands.


The regression coefficients:

- c0 = -9.674
- c1 = 0.653
- c2 = 9.087

where obtained by:

- 946 cloud-free TIGR atmospheric profiles,
- the new high accurate atmospheric radiative transfer model MODTRAN 5.2
- simulating the band effective atmospheric transmittance

Model analysis indicated that this method will obtain a CWV RMSE of about
0.5 g/cm2. Details about the CWV retrieval can be found in:

<h4>Modified Split-Window Covariance-Variance Method</h4>

<h3>Land Surface Temperature</h3>

<h4>Split-Window Algorithm</h4>
A class implementing the split-window algorithm for Landsat8 imagery

Inputs:

- The class itself requires only a string for 'landcover' which is:

    1) a fixed land cover class string (one from the classes defined in the
        FROM-GLC legend)

    2) a land cover class code (integer) one from the classes defined in the
        FROM-GLC classification scheme.

- Inputs for individual functions vary, look at their definitions.

Outputs:

- Valid expressions for GRASS GIS' r.mapcalc raster processing module
- Direct computation for...  though not necessary, nor useful for GRASS GIS
    modules directly?


Details

The algorithm removes the atmospheric effect through differential
atmospheric absorption in the two adjacent thermal infrared channels
centered at about 11 and 12 μm.

The linear or non-linear combination of the brightness temperatures is
finally applied for LST estimation based on the equation:

LST =  b0 +
    + (b1 + b2 * ((1-ae)/ae)) +
    +  b3 * (de/ae) * ((t10 + t11)/2) +
    + (b4 + b5 * ((1-ae)/ae) + b6 * (de/ae^2)) * ((t10 - t11)/2) +
    +  b7 * (t10 - t11)^2

To reduce the influence of the CWV error on the LST, for a CWV within the
overlap of two adjacent CWV sub-ranges, we first use the coefficients from
the two adjacent CWV sub-ranges to calculate the two initial temperatures
and then use the average of the initial temperatures as the pixel LST.

For example, the LST pixel with a CWV of 2.1 g/cm2 is estimated by using
the coefficients of [0.0, 2.5] and [2.0, 3.5]. This process initially
reduces the δLSTinc and improves the spatial continuity of the LST product.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

At minimum, the module requires the following in order to derive a land surface temperature map:

1. The Landsat8 scene's acquisition metadata (MTL file) 
2. Bands 10, 11 and QA
3. The FROM-GLC product for the same Path and Row

The shorted call for processing a complete Landsat8 scene normally is:
<div class="code"><pre>
i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC
</pre></div>

where:
<ul>
<li>mtl= the name of the MTL metadata file (normally with a ".txt" extension)</li>
<li>prefix= the prefix of the band names imported in GRASS GIS' data base</li>
<li>landcover= the name of the FROM-GLC map that covers the extent of the Landsat8 scene under processing</li>
</ul>

<p>The pixel value 61440 is selected to automatically to build a cloud mask. At
the moment, only one pixel value may be requested from the Quality Assessment
band. For details, refer to
http://landsat.usgs.gov/L8QualityAssessmentBand.php.

<p>In order to restrict the processing in to the currently set computational region, the "-k" flag can be used:
<div class="code"><pre>
i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC -k 
</pre></div>

<p>A user defined map for clouds, instead of relying on the Quality Assessment
band, can be used via the <em>clouds=</em> option:
<div class="code"><pre>
i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC clouds=Cloud_Map -k 
</pre></div>

<p>The Celsius color table may be applied for the output land surface temperature map via the "-c" flag:
<div class="code"><pre>
i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC -c 
</pre></div>

<p>The user can use existing at-satellite temperature maps via the "t10" and "t11" options, selectively. For example:
<div class="code"><pre>
i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL b10=B10 t11=AtSatellite_Temperature_11 landcover=FROM_GLC -c 
</pre></div>

or

<div class="code"><pre>
i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL t10=AtSatellite_Temperature_10 t11=AtSatellite_Temperature_11 landcover=FROM_GLC -c 
</pre></div>

<p>Expert users may need to request for a "fixed" average surface emissivity to
perform the algorithm for a single land cover class (one from the classes
defined in the FROM-GLC classification scheme) via the "emissivity_class"
option. Consequently, the emissivity_class cannot be used at the same time with
the "landover" option.
<div class="code"><pre>
i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL b10=B10 t11=AtSatellite_Temperature_11 qab=BQA emissivity_class='Croplands' -c 
</pre></div>

A complete "transparent" run-through of what and how the module performs computations, may be requested via the use of both the "--v" and "-i" flags:
<div class="code"><pre>
i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC -i --v 
</pre></div>

<p>This will print out a description of each individual processing step, as well as the actual mathematical epxressions applied via GRASS GIS' r.mapcalc module.

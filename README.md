A new refinement of the generalized split-window algorithm proposed by Wan 
(2014) [19] is added with a quadratic term of the difference amongst the 
brightness temperatures (Ti, Tj) of the adjacent thermal infrared channels, 
which can be expressed as

LST = b0 + [b1 + b2 * (1−ε)/ε + b3 * (Δε/ε2)] * (Ti+T)/j2 + [b4 + b5 * (1−ε)/ε + b6 * (Δε/ε2)] * (Ti−Tj)/2 + b7 * (Ti−Tj)^2
(2)

where:

  - Ti and Tj are the TOA brightness temperatures measured in channels i 
(~11.0 μm) and j (~12.0 µm), respectively;
  - ε is the average emissivity of the two channels (i.e., ε = 0.5 [εi + εj]),
  - Δε is the channel emissivity difference (i.e., Δε = εi − εj);
  - bk (k = 0,1,...7) are the algorithm coefficients derived in the following 
  simulated dataset.
